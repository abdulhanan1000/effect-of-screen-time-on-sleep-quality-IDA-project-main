\begin{abstract}
    This study examines how screen time before bed affects sleep quality. We collected data from 30 participants and used logistic regression to analyze the relationship between screen time and sleep quality. The results show that spending more than 2 hours on screens before bed is linked to poorer sleep quality. These findings suggest that reducing screen time before bed could improve sleep quality.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Context and Motivation}
The digital revolution has basically transformed human behavior patterns, particularly in the crucial hours before sleep. The use of smartphones, tablets, and computers has led to alarming levels of screen exposure, raising significant concerns about its impact on sleep quality and overall health.

\subsection{Research Objectives}
This study aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantify the relationship between before bedtime screen exposure and sleep quality
\item Identify potential threshold effects in screen time duration
\item Develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal screen time management
\item Contribute to the broader understanding of digital wellness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Questions}
Primary research questions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1: What is the quantitative relationship between pre-bedtime screen time and sleep quality?
\item RQ2: Is there a critical threshold of screen time beyond which sleep quality significantly deteriorates?
\item RQ3: What are the implications for developing effective sleep hygiene interventions?
\end{itemize}

\section{Background and Literature Review}
\subsection{Theoretical Framework}
The relationship between screen exposure and sleep quality is grounded in several theoretical frameworks:

\subsubsection{Circadian Rhythm Theory}
Research has shown that exposure to blue light from digital devices can suppress melatonin production, disrupting the natural circadian rhythm. Studies by Chang et al. (2015) demonstrated earlier that blue light exposure can delay the production of melatonin by up to 3 hours \cite{chang2015}.

\subsubsection{Sleep Hygiene Model}
Traditional sleep hygiene models are being revised to incorporate the challenges posed by digital device usage, suggesting the need for updated guidelines that account for modern technology use patterns \cite{cajochen2011}.

\subsection{Previous Research}
Recent studies have identified several key mechanisms through which screen time affects sleep:

\subsubsection{Physiological Mechanisms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Blue light exposure affecting melatonin production \cite{chang2015}
\item Increased cognitive arousal and neural activation \cite{heath2014}
\item Altered sleep-wake cycle regulation \cite{cajochen2011}
\item Changes in core body temperature patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Psychological Mechanisms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Content-induced emotional arousal
\item Fear of missing out (FOMO)
\item Digital anxiety and stress
\item Delayed sleep onset due to engagement
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Research Design}
\subsubsection{Study Type}
This research employed a cross-sectional observational design with quantitative analysis. The design was chosen to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Capture current patterns of screen use and sleep quality
\item Enable statistical modeling of relationships
\item Facilitate comparison across demographic groups
\item Allow for robust statistical inference
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sampling Strategy}
Participants were recruited using:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stratified random sampling within the population
\item Voluntary participation with informed consent
\item Inclusion/exclusion criteria based on screen time usage
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This study provides evidence for the relationship between screen time and sleep quality. The identification of a threshold effect at 2 hours of pre-bed screen time offers guidance for developing interventions and recommendations. However, the results are limited by the exclusion of factors such as age and gender, the limited scope, and the small sample size. Future research should address these limitations to provide more comprehensive insights. While acknowledging methodological limitations, the study's findings contribute to our understanding of digital wellness and sleep health.
